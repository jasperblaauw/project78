Developing an electronic bracelet and app for nursing homes.


### ips:
We used a simple breath-first search algorithm to find the nearest nurse.<br>
When the bracelet is in navigation mode, it keeps polling the server to see if the direction changed.<br>
The server changes the direction if the person wearing the bracelet passes a chokepoint.
